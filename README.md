# DiscordWebhookManager
A program for storing and using discord webhooks. Supports changing themes and storing avatars for use by webhooks.
To add themes you can drag them into a themes folder (there is a button in the settings to open it)
You can create your own themes: create a copy of the theme, rename it, open it as a text file and change the data.
